# Introduction to Cloud Computing

    ## Different Service Models

    Refer diagram below:

    ![ServiceModels](https://github.com/nnsantosh/cloud_computing/blob/master/Cloud_Service_Models.jpg)

    1. Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
        Example: AWS EC2, Azure, rackspace

    2. Platform as a service (PaaS)
        Example: Managed Database, Managed Messaging system in AWS or Azure


    3. Software as a service (SaaS)
        Example: Gmail, Salesforce


    ## Characteristics of Cloud Computing

    1. On-demand self service
        A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without
        requiring human interaction with each service provider.

    2. Broad Network access
        Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogenous thin or thick client platforms(e.g.         mobile phones, tablets, laptops and workstations)

    3. Resource pooling
        The provider's computing resources are pooled to to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources           dynamically assigned according to consumer demand. There is a sense of location independence in that consumers generally has no control or knowledge over         the exact location of the provided resources but may be able to specify location at a higher level of abstraction(e.g. country, state, or data center).           Examples of resource pooling including storage, processing, memory and network bandwidth.

    4. Rapid elasticity
        Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with the demand.        To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time.

    5. Measured service
        Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of         service(e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth and active user accounts). Resource usage can be monitored, controlled and reported, providing transparency         for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.

    ## Deployment Models

      This is more about procurement and how you buy them. It is nothing to do with applications or data.

      1. Private Cloud
          The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a single organization comprising multiple consumers (e.g., business units). It may be               owned, managed and operated by the organization, a third party, or some combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises.

      2. Community Cloud
          The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a specific community of consumers from organizations that have shared concerns (e.g.,               mission, security requirements, policy and compliance considerations). It may be owned, managed and operated by one or more of the organizations in the           community, a third party or some combination of of them, and it may exist on or off premises.

      3. Public Cloud
          The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for open use by the general public. It may be owned, managed, and operated by a business, academic or                     government organization, or some combination of them. It exists on the premises of the cloud provider.

      4. Hybrid Cloud
          The cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more distinct cloud infrastructures(private, community or public) that remain unique entities, but           are bound together by standardized or propriety technology that enables data and application portability (e.g., cloud bursting for load balancing                 between clouds).
